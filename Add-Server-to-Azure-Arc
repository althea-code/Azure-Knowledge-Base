#below are instructions for adding a new server to Azure Arc
#this example is using a linux server, but similar steps are used for windows servers

1. Generate a Script in Azure
  Go to Azure.Portal -> Azure Arc -> Add/Create -> Add a machine
  Generate the desired Script

2. Transfer Script
  Transfer over SFTP. I like to use WINSCP

3. Execute Script and authenticate
  use >chmod +x yourscript.sh in Bash to make the file executable
  execute script in Linux server with >./yourscript.sh
  Script with likely ask you to login to azure and authenticate with provided authentication code
  Once connection is authenticated, script will finish running, and once its finished, machine should be visible in Azure Arc
